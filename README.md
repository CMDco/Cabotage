# Cabotage
Cabotage enables real time data subscriptions to GraphQL APIs. 

## Disclaimer
The cabotage is under active development. Every feature should be considered experimental and has the possibility of breaking or being removed in the future. If you have any questions, comments, suggestions for features, or any other concerns please contact [Martin-Ting](https://github.com/martin-ting). Our team (listed below) is very open to suggestions and feedback and encourage it if you try our library out. We hope to provide a great tool for graphQL developers to bring real time data to their APIs.

We are also considering a name change in the short future so watch out for that. We will keep the deprecated project/package on npm and github with an updated disclaimer regarding the name change.
